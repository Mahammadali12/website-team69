    <h2><br>Learning Process</h2>
    <p class="LearningProcessp">
      To start off, we, of course, have to know some basics if we want to even attempt to build a website. For that, we need to know
      how to use  the standard markup language for creating Web pages which is HTML. On top of that, we need to learn how to
      describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. And for that, we use CSS, Cascading Style Sheets.
      To learn how to actually program in these languages to our help comes CodeAcademy. CodeAcademy offers a variety of free or paid
      courses that greatly help to lay out the foundation for these languages that we need to know. Its HTML and CSS courses introduced
      each of us to previously never-known languages HTML and CSS. The courses are divided into modules. HTML course consists of 4 modules
      and is 9 hours long. On the other hand, CSS is a 6 module course. To top it off, we also need a scripting language that enables you
      to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else which would be JavaScript.
      Now, CodeAcademy also offers a Java course which consists of 10 modules. The initial learning process, despite being challenging, was very rewarding.<br><br>
      There were concepts that we could not understand at first, but with added bit of practice things started clicking for us. Each team member still
      has some problems regarding how to code and implement certain things into the website, but overall it was very informative and educational.

    <h2><br>Ideas Behind The Design</h2>
    <p class="IdeasBehindTheDesignp">
      The website's design is characterized by a thoughtful and visually engaging layout. The home page serves as a central hub, featuring clear navigation
      links to dedicated sections like Team, Hour of Code, and About Us. The incorporation of distinct buttons for each section enhances user interaction,
      providing an intuitive and visually appealing experience. The color scheme, consisting of a vibrant gradient background and consistent use of white
      and black, contributes to a cohesive aesthetic throughout the site. The header tags and font styles are strategically utilized to create a well-organized hierarchy,
      guiding users seamlessly through the content. The team section exemplifies a clean and structured layout, combining images with detailed descriptions of each team member.
      The use of "Learn More" buttons encourages users to delve deeper into individual profiles. The Hour of Code and Website Project sections maintain a consistent design
      approach, presenting information with relevant images and maintaining a unified aesthetic. the CSS coding further showcases emphasizing both functionality and aesthetics
      in styling, including responsive design elements such as hover effects on buttons.<br><br> We hope that the overall design reflects a strong foundation in web development principles,
      prioritizing both functionality and aesthetic coherence.

    <h2><br>Main Challenges</h2>
    <p class="MainChallengesp">
      Creating a website with a thoughtful and visually engaging design poses challenges in maintaining consistency, ensuring a seamless user experience, and implementing responsive elements.
      The learning curve for mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be steep, requiring time and practice.Integrating<br> dynamic content and fostering effective team collaboration are additional hurdles.
      Translating design concepts into functional code, staying updated with evolving web technologies, and troubleshooting issues are ongoing challenges.
      Despite these obstacles, the process is rewarding, with the combination of design principles, coding skills, and teamwork culminating in the development of a functional and aesthetically coherent website.
