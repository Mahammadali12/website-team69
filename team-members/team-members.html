      <p class="text">I'm Yusif Behbudov, born on November 2, 2004, and currently, I'm immersed in the world of Computer Science at ADA University.
          Code and algorithms fuel my curiosity, making each day a new adventure in technology.
          Beyond the digital realm, I find joy in the tangibleâ€”flipping through books, exploring the vast landscapes of scientific-fictional films, and mastering the strategic moves of 8-ball pool.
          My academic journey is a constant blend of challenges and discoveries, as I navigate the evolving landscape of computer science.
          Join me on this exciting ride, where passion meets pixels, and every line of code tells a story.

                 I am passionate about IT and I hope to pursue a career in that field after graduation. I decided to become a IT Engineer because I have always been fascinated by computer, coding and cyber security. In addition, I have developed many hobbies in my life. In my free time, I love reading, computer and internet, music and sports.

            <p class="text">Hi, there! My name is Suleyman Abiyev was born in 2006, born and bread in Azerbaijan. When I first started attending school, I had a pretty hard time getting to know what I liked, but 
                later on, I found out I had passion towards computers and everything related to them! So that is the reason why I chose
                to major in Computer Science. My hobbies are reading and cooking. I just find these things very relaxing, and  useful too!
                Hope you had a good time getting to know me!</p>
