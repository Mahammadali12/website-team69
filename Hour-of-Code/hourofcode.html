      The event commenced with a general overview of key concepts such as algorithms, coding, and programming languages, skillfully presented and defined by our team members.
       Each team member delved into specific segments of the presentation, meticulously prepared for the hour of code event.
        Following the introduction, the practical utility of these concepts was elucidated through clear and succinct examples.
         Subsequently, team members incorporated hour of code courses, providing the class with a firsthand experience of coding.
          During these coding sessions, team members offered guidance, allowing students both collaborative and individual opportunities to showcase their coding prowess.

      The theoretical part of the lesson began smoothly, with students grasping concepts and providing clear examples of real-life algorithms.
       However, challenges arose during the hour of code courses. Initially, students struggled to start and comprehend tasks, requiring team member assistance.
        As the lesson progressed, students improved, demonstrating better understanding by the end. Despite some challenging examples, students developed a solid grasp of core ideas and their practical applications.

Our main challenge was locating an educational institution willing to host our Hour of Code event.
 The initial school we approached required a special permit from the ministry, which we lacked.
  The second school, found later, initially agreed but abruptly canceled, citing ongoing exams and full classrooms.
   After last-minute adjustments, we secured an alternative venue, but it lacked the necessary equipment.
    Without a projector, each team member had to lead groups on separate laptops, presenting our prepared material.
     Additionally, the unreliable internet connection posed difficulties, often going out completely. Time constraints further complicated the already challenging experience.
